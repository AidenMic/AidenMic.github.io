		<h3>A website under construction by a nerd</h3>
		<p>Have you ever wondered, "Hey I wonder what a partially-finished website would look like?"  You probably haven't, I don't think that's a common question.  But if you did, this would be one example!</p>
		<p>I would like to specifically apologize to anyone looking to this website to gauge my hirability, I have not had as much time to work on this website as I would have liked.  Despite this, I still thought it would be a good idea to put it on applications if only to show that I have worked on something before, and I am planning on updating and adding content in my free time during the near future.</p>
